Hello world, my name is Tiffany Chen! Still developing my style & type of content I want to extend to the depths of the internet, but for now Iâ€™m starting with book/movie reviews & personal reflections. I generally do my best processing via writing (big fan of journals) so this site will be a nice way for me to synthesize and condense my musings.
