<p>An absolute behemoth of a novel, Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens is not an easy feat to power through. My version was a thick 800 pages and it took a long while before I felt confident that I was interested enough to finish the book. Despite my early apprehension, Our Mutual Friend proved to be an epic story woven with beautiful if not macabre plots that contribute to the overall sophistication of the book. Although I wouldn’t do it again, I’m very glad I read this entire novel.</p>

<h2 id="surrogacy-and-bradley-headstone">Surrogacy and Bradley Headstone</h2>

<p>I have Professor Jeff Nunokawa to thank for most of the insights about this book, but the most moving theme that he pointed out was that of surrogacy. “Who has the privilege of having a surrogate?” The answer is not everyone. My favorite depiction in the novel is that of Bradley Headstone. It’s painful to watch him spiral but I also feel a deep sympathy for him despite his bestial behavior. Bradley Headstone cannot afford to have a surrogate.</p>

<p>For example, he’s absolutely obsessed with his “rival” Eugene but Eugene doesn’t even acknowledge him as a human being. He can’t use Eugene as a stand-in for his own desires if Eugene is so many metaphorical levels higher than him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t know, Mr. Wrayburn,” answered Bradley, with his passion rising, “why you address me–“</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t you?” said Eugene. “Then I won’t.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity, that the respectable right-hand clutching the respectable hair-guard of the respectable watch could have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you not feel bad for Bradley? He’s reduced to a simmering pot boiling over and Eugene is an ice cold statue of aloofness. He becomes Eugene’s shadow but Eugene just toys with him and leads him on a wild goose chase. The frustration that Bradley feels is so rife in this book that it makes you think twice about who gets to be happy in this world. When he’s unsuccessful in killing Eugene, he essentially has no chance at happiness and is reduced to a fetal child.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For whichsoever reason, or for all, [Bradley] drooped his devoted head when the boy was gone, and shrank together on the floor, and grovelled there, with the palms of his hands tight-clasping his hot temples, in unutterable misery, and unrelieved by a single tear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He even failed in having a surrogate to shift blame. He tried to dress up like Riderhood to hide his attack on Eugene but that backfired miserably and basically resulted in his own death. When Mr. Fledgeby, a total jerk, gets away with using Mr. Riah to do his dirty work all the time, Bradley is never afforded that opportunity. Of all the characters in Our Mutual Friend, I feel the worst for Bradley. He was just a normal guy who taught in a school and was suddenly overwhelmed with a passion with no outlet whatsoever. He dies the most ignominious death and I shudder every time I re-read it.</p>

<p>Jeff said that one of his former students came up to him in a NYC subway 10 years after taking his class and just said, “I can’t believe they did all that just to test that poor girl.”</p>

<p>After reading the whole book, I understand how that plot twist can haunt you for so many years after the fact. Excuse me? They just pulled a giant prank on Bella to test that she’s not a mercenary anymore? I would be absolutely i n f u r i a t e d if my husband revealed he has been pulling my leg all along, but Bella just seems to accept it as all good and well (?)! It felt glossed over a little too quickly in the book and I thought Dickens could have done a better job fleshing out the ramifications of this deceit for how their marriage proceeds, or perhaps delving into how Bella might have changed her outlook on wealth after acquisition. Considering how he spent so many pages detailing 2-dimensional characters like the Veneerings and the Podsnaps, I thought he could have done the post-reveal story a little more justice.</p>
