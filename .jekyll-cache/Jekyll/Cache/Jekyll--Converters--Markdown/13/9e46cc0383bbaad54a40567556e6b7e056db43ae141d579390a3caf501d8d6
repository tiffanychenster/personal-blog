<p>An absolute behemoth of a novel, Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens is not an easy feat to power through. My version was a thick 800 pages and it took a long while before I felt confident that I was interested enough to finish the book. Despite my early apprehension, Our Mutual Friend proved to be an epic story woven with beautiful if not macabre plots that contribute to the overall sophistication of the book. Although I wouldn’t do it again, I’m very glad I read this entire novel.</p>

<h2 id="surrogacy-and-bradley-headstone">Surrogacy and Bradley Headstone</h2>

<p>I have Professor Jeff Nunokawa to thank for most of the insights about this book, but the most moving theme that he pointed out was that of surrogacy. “Who has the privilege of having a surrogate?” The answer is not everyone. My favorite depiction in the novel is that of Bradley Headstone. It’s painful to watch him spiral but I also feel a deep sympathy for him despite his bestial behavior. Bradley Headstone cannot afford to have a surrogate.</p>

<p>For example, he’s absolutely obsessed with his “rival” Eugene but Eugene doesn’t even acknowledge him as a human being. He can’t use Eugene as a stand-in for his own desires if Eugene is so many metaphorical levels higher than him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t know, Mr. Wrayburn,” answered Bradley, with his passion rising, “why you address me–“</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t you?” said Eugene. “Then I won’t.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity, that the respectable right-hand clutching the respectable hair-guard of the respectable watch could have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it.</p>
