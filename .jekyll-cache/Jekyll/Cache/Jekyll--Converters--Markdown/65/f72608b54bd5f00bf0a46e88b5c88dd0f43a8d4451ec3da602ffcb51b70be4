<p>An absolute behemoth of a novel, Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens is not an easy feat to power through. My version was a thick 800 pages and it took a long while before I felt confident that I was interested enough to finish the book. Despite my early apprehension, Our Mutual Friend proved to be an epic story woven with beautiful if not macabre plots that contribute to the overall sophistication of the book. Although I wouldn’t do it again, I’m very glad I read this entire novel.</p>
