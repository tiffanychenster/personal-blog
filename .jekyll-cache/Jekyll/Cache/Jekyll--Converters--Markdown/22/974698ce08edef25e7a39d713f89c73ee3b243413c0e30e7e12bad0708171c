<p>An absolute behemoth of a novel, Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens is not an easy feat to power through. My version was a thick 800 pages and it took a long while before I felt confident that I was interested enough to finish the book. Despite my early apprehension, Our Mutual Friend proved to be an epic story woven with beautiful if not macabre plots that contribute to the overall sophistication of the book. Although I wouldn‚Äôt do it again, I‚Äôm very glad I read this entire novel.</p>

<h2 id="surrogacy-and-bradley-headstone">Surrogacy and Bradley Headstone</h2>

<p>I have Professor Jeff Nunokawa to thank for most of the insights about this book, but the most moving theme that he pointed out was that of surrogacy. ‚ÄúWho has the privilege of having a surrogate?‚Äù The answer is not everyone. My favorite depiction in the novel is that of Bradley Headstone. It‚Äôs painful to watch him spiral but I also feel a deep sympathy for him despite his bestial behavior. Bradley Headstone cannot afford to have a surrogate.</p>

<p>For example, he‚Äôs absolutely obsessed with his ‚Äúrival‚Äù Eugene but Eugene doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge him as a human being. He can‚Äôt use Eugene as a stand-in for his own desires if Eugene is so many metaphorical levels higher than him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Mr. Wrayburn,‚Äù answered Bradley, with his passion rising, ‚Äúwhy you address me‚Äì‚Äú</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you?‚Äù said Eugene. ‚ÄúThen I won‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity, that the respectable right-hand clutching the respectable hair-guard of the respectable watch could have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you not feel bad for Bradley? He‚Äôs reduced to a simmering pot boiling over and Eugene is an ice cold statue of aloofness. He becomes Eugene‚Äôs shadow but Eugene just toys with him and leads him on a wild goose chase. The frustration that Bradley feels is so rife in this book that it makes you think twice about who gets to be happy in this world. When he‚Äôs unsuccessful in killing Eugene, he essentially has no chance at happiness and is reduced to a fetal child.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For whichsoever reason, or for all, [Bradley] drooped his devoted head when the boy was gone, and shrank together on the floor, and grovelled there, with the palms of his hands tight-clasping his hot temples, in unutterable misery, and unrelieved by a single tear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He even failed in having a surrogate to shift blame. He tried to dress up like Riderhood to hide his attack on Eugene but that backfired miserably and basically resulted in his own death. When Mr. Fledgeby, a total jerk, gets away with using Mr. Riah to do his dirty work all the time, Bradley is never afforded that opportunity. Of all the characters in Our Mutual Friend, I feel the worst for Bradley. He was just a normal guy who taught in a school and was suddenly overwhelmed with a passion with no outlet whatsoever. He dies the most ignominious death and I shudder every time I re-read it.</p>

<em>Mr. Boffin berating John Rokesmith in front of Bella</em></p>

<p>Jeff said that one of his former students came up to him in a NYC subway 10 years after taking his class and just said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe they did all that just to test that poor girl.‚Äù</p>

<p>After reading the whole book, I understand how that plot twist can haunt you for so many years after the fact. Excuse me? They just pulled a giant prank on Bella to test that she‚Äôs not a mercenary anymore? I would be absolutely i n f u r i a t e d if my husband revealed he has been pulling my leg all along, but Bella just seems to accept it as all good and well (?)! It felt glossed over a little too quickly in the book and I thought Dickens could have done a better job fleshing out the ramifications of this deceit for how their marriage proceeds, or perhaps delving into how Bella might have changed her outlook on wealth after acquisition. Considering how he spent so many pages detailing 2-dimensional characters like the Veneerings and the Podsnaps, I thought he could have done the post-reveal story a little more justice.</p>

<h3 id="plot-summary-spoilers"><em>Plot Summary (Spoilers)</em></h3>

<p><em>This 19th-century novel focuses on multiple intertwined stories that all revolve around the dead body of John Harmon. Gaffer Hexam and his daughter Lizzie find a dead body in the River Thames that is supposedly that of John Harmon. Harmon is the heir to the fortune of John Harmon Sr, who left all of his dust heaps to his son on the condition that he marries a girl named Bella Wilfer. Now that Harmon Jr. is dead, the fortune defaults to Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, a married couple who served Mr. Harmon all his life. The Boffins, a rather simple but kind type of people, unofficially adopt Bella Wilfer. Bella comes from a poor background but sets her sights on becoming wealthy via marriage. Meanwhile, a Mr. John Rokesmith appears out of thin air and becomes a lodger in Mr. Wilfer‚Äôs property and obtains an unpaid role as Mr. Boffin‚Äôs secretary after much persistence. He falls in love with Bella Wilfer but is reluctant to act on his feelings since she openly declares she will only marry for money. He ends up confessing his feelings but Bella quickly turns him down.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lizzie Hexam helps her brother Charlie run away to a school in order to escape the hard-stuck illiterate ways of her father. The Headmaster of the school, Bradley Headstone, falls violently in love with Lizzie and thinks of nothing but acquiring her. A young well-to-do lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn, is also beginning to fall in love with Lizzie but is ambivalent in acting on his love. Gaffer is accused by nemesis Riderhood of murdering John Harmon Jr but drowns before anyone can question him. Lizzie works with and befriends a young disabled girl, Jenny Wren, who makes dolls for a living.</p>

<p>Mr. Boffin undergoes an uncanny transformation in Bella‚Äôs eyes, becoming miserly and obsessed with money. The final straw for Bella comes when he utterly denounces Mr. Rokesmith after finding out that he tried to marry Bella. She leaves Boffin mansion and marries Mr. Rokesmith. Once married, Mr. Rokesmith is on edge and constantly asks Bella if she would like to be richer, but she emphasizes her contentment with love rather than wealth. Concurrently, peg-legged villain Silas Wegg infiltrates Mr. Boffin‚Äôs home under the guise of a ‚Äúnovel reader‚Äù but eventually tries to extort money from Mr. Boffin. He blackmails Mr. Boffin with a will that states that his inheritance is illegitimate.</p>

<p>The plot twist unravels here as it is shown that Mr. Rokesmith, who is actually John Harmon Jr. all along, is actually in cahoots with the Boffins. They realized early on the true identity of Mr. Rokesmith and had devised a plan to test the sincerity of Bella‚Äôs love for him and to ensure she is not merely a mercenary wench. Wegg‚Äôs blackmail is useless because the latest version of Harmon‚Äôs will indicates the entirety of the fortune defaults to the Boffins. They graciously bestow a portion of the wealth on John and Bella anyways.</p>

<p>Bradley Headstone follows Eugene Wrayburn around in order to discover where Lizzie ran away to, but Eugene doesn‚Äôt know and he enjoys leading Bradley on a wild goose chase every night. Bradley resigns to attempting to kill Eugene with the help of Riderhood, and he dresses up as Riderhood to shift blame in case anyone sees him. He severely cripples Eugene but Lizzie happens to find him and save his life and she ends up getting married to Eugen on his near-deathbed. News of Eugene‚Äôs survival and marriage destroys Bradley and after Riderhood comes back for revenge to extort Bradley, they fight and fall to their deaths. Eugene makes a splendid recovery and is happily married to Lizzie.</p>

<p>There is also an extensive sub-plot regarding Mr. and Mrs. Lammle, a mercenary couple who devise many schemes to cheat others; Mr. Riah and Mr. Fledgeby, the latter exploiting the former to run his money-lending business; and the Podsnaps, a wealthy family who excessively attempt to prove their belonging in high-class society.</p>
